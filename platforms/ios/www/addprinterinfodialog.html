                <h1>Host and Hostname</h1>
                <p>From this section, you can add your printer's name (serial number) and its hostname (so that this app may connect to it).</p>
                <p>Your printer has a serial number on the back:
                    <strong><i>serial-number</i></strong> as its name and
                    <strong><i>serial-number</i>.local</strong> as its hostname...</p>
                <p>...which will work for anyone with an OS X or iOS computer or those who have installed iTunes (specifically the related Bonjour broadcast protocol from Appple).
                </p>
                <p>For anyone else, for the <strong>hostname</strong> field they will need to use the <strong>dotted IP address</strong> of their printer which can be found in the LCD menu under Utilities -> Network.
                </p>
                <h1>Printer API Key</h1>
                <p>This section allows you to enter your printer's API key which is essential for permissioning you to gather information from it. You can find this under the LCD's Utilities -> Network -> API QR Code menu option.</p>
                <h1>Webcam URL</h1>
                <p>If you have one, this section will connect this app with your printer's optional webcam. You may then use this app to stream a live video feed from your printer.</p>
                <h1>Finalize Setup</h1>
                <p>This section will complete the profile for your new printer so that you can connect to it with this app.</p>
