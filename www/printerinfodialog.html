                <h1>Motor Controls</h1>
                <p>From this section, you can control the movement of the print head assembly as well as the height of the print bed. Finally, the extruder motor may also be controlled.</p>
                <p>Your printer has three axes of control:
                    <strong>X</strong>,
                    <strong>Y</strong> (gantry controls of the upper assembly) and
                    <strong>Z</strong> (moving the print bed platform)...</p>
                <p>...as well as the controls for the fourth stepper motor:
                    <strong>Extruder</strong> (extruding and retracting filament).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Choose the axis/stepper you want to control (X, Y, Z, Extruder)</li>
                        <li>Choose the jog amount (this controls how far the print head/bed/filament moves each time)</li>
                        <li>Use the left/right, up/down, extrude/retract pairs of buttons to step the appropriate motor by the indicated amount</li>
                        <li>Use the home button to return the print head and print bed to their home positions</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <h1>Temperature</h1>
                <p>This section displays and controls the target temperature of the extruder(s) and the heated print bed option, if installed.</p>
                <h1>Filament</h1>
                <p>This section displays the filament profiles and their related default target temperatures.</p>
                <h1>Settings</h1>
                <p>This section displays information from the printer's connection settings.</p>
                <h1>Files</h1>
                <p>From this section, you can view a list of files and folders which are on the microSD card in the printer as well as those in an inserted USB drive.</p>
